# What's All This, Then?
The Open Snapshot Framework for Blackboard Learn 9.1 is a framework for schools to follow who wish to implement their own integration between Learn 9.1 and their own SIS. 

Our hope is that the OSNAP project becomes a home for many different implementations of the same idea.

## Getting Started with OSNAP
There are three major steps involved in integrating your SIS and LMS:

1. **Extract** the data from your SIS
2. **Transform** the data to Blackboard's spec
3. **Load** the data into the LMS
